django_custom_user_migration creates migrations for you to move an existing
Django project that uses ``django.contrib.auth.models.User`` to using a custom user
model.

Free software: BSD license

Use case
--------

You are currently using Django's ``django.contrib.auth.models.User`` model in a
deployed project, but want to migrate to a model that is under your own control, or
provided by a 3rd party.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Django 1.8 or later
* Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+

You must have ensured that everywhere in your project (including 3rd party
libraries) you are using ``AUTH_USER_MODEL`` and
``django.contrib.auth.get_user_model()`` rather than ``"auth.User"`` and
``django.contrib.auth.models.User``.


Usage
-----

There are a lot of steps below, but it is almost all copy/paste, and with no
complications you could be done in 5 minutes.

1. Install ``django_custom_user_migration`` to your project::

     pip install django_custom_user_migration

2. Add ``"django_custom_user_migration"`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

   You now have some management commands for creating migrations that we
   will use later.

3. Create a custom user model which is identical to Django's ``auth.User``, but
   in an app in your own project. For this process to work correctly, you will
   need to create a new app for this model - we'll call it ``accounts`` from now
   on::

     # accounts/models.py

     from django_custom_user_migration.models import AbstractUser

     class User(AbstractUser):
         pass

   The model can be called anything you want. Remember to add this app to your
   ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

   Don't add additional fields at this point, and don't change
   ``AUTH_USER_MODEL`` yet.

   We avoid using ``django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractUser`` at this point, or
   a user model from some 3rd party library, because we get problems with
   ``related_name`` clashes that we can't work around. Later on, we'll change to
   inheriting from ``django.contrib.auth.AbstractUser``, and then to another model
   if necessary.

4. Create a normal migration to create the table for this::

     ./manage.py makemigrations accounts

   This migration must be ``0001_initial`` or you will have problems later on,
   as mentioned in the docs for `AUTH_USER_MODEL
   <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#auth-user-model>`_.

   The migration will also create M2M tables for the M2M fields specified
   on ``AbstractUser`` itself.

5. Create a data migration that will populate these tables from ``auth.User``::

     ./manage.py create_custom_user_populate_migration auth.User accounts.User

   All the commands to create migrations take arguments <from_model> <to_model> like this.

6. Create a schema migration that will alter every FK that points at ``auth.User``
   to point at your model instead::

     ./manage.py create_custom_user_schema_migration auth.User accounts.User

7. Create a data migration that will fix up the contenttypes tables::

     ./manage.py create_custom_user_contenttypes_migration auth.User accounts.User

8. Change the ``AbstractUser`` import in your models.py to::

      from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

9. Change ``AUTH_USER_MODEL`` to ``"accounts.User"`` in your settings.

10. Run ``makemigrations`` again::

      ./manage.py makemigrations accounts

    This creates a migration that doesn't actually change fields, but is needed
    for Django to think that everything lines up again.

11. Do related changes for admin etc. as described in Django docs:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#extending-django-s-default-user

    Simplest version::

      # accounts/admin.py

      from django.contrib import admin
      from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin
      from . models import User

      admin.site.register(User, UserAdmin)

12. Create a migration that empties the ``auth.User`` table::

      ./manage.py create_custom_user_empty_migration auth.User accounts.User

13. Run all the migrations::

      ./manage.py migrate

14. Test everything!

    Note that all migrations generated are reversible, but before running them
    in reverse you should set AUTH_USER_MODEL back to ``"auth.User"``, and you
    will also therefore need to use the
    ``django_custom_user_migration.models.AbstractModel`` as a base class or you
    will get validation errors that prevent migrations from running.

15. Uninstall ``django_custom_user_migration``, you don't need it any more. The
    migrations generated run without it being installed.


You can now customise your ``User`` model as required in the normal way, using
migrations etc. You could even make it inherit from ``AbstractBaseUser`` or some
other model instead of ``AbstractUser``, provided that you write/generate the
necessary data migrations to cope with missing fields, and update your admin and
application accordingly.


Other notes
-----------

* Use at own risk, etc. etc.

* Tested on sqlite and postgres

* If you have other tables with FKs to ``auth.User`` that Django doesn't know
  about, you will have to deal with those manually with a custom migration. (In
  really old Django projects, you might have old tables like 'auth_message'
  kicking around which you'll need to delete).

* Almost everything included in this library is generic regarding the models
  involved, and uses introspection rather than hard-coding things about
  ``auth.User``. The main exception is
  ``django_custom_user_migration.models.AbstractUser``, which is a copy-paste
  job from Django sources.

  This means that you may be able to use the code here to migrate other
  swappable models. This has not been tested however.
